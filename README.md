# 🧠 MoodMate: AI Agent for Emotional Check

MoodMate is a Flask-based **Generative AI-powered emotion detection agent** that analyzes a user's text input and identifies their **emotional state**.  
It responds empathetically using natural language, simulating emotional understanding and support.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**MoodMate** detects emotions from user text such as *“I feel so tired today”* or *“I’m really happy!”*,  
then classifies them into one of **20 emotional categories** and generates a matching AI-driven response.  

### 🎯 Objectives
- To detect users' emotions accurately using NLP-based emotion recognition.
- To build an interactive, AI-powered emotional companion.
- To promote mental well-being through empathetic responses.
- To demonstrate real-world integration of Flask, NLP, and Generative AI.

## 💬 Supported Emotions

MoodMate currently detects **20 emotions**:
> Happy, Sad, Angry, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Confused, Relaxed, Love, Hopeful,  
> Lonely, Guilty, Proud, Jealous, Bored, Embarrassed, Grateful, Curious, **Tired**, Neutral

Each emotion triggers personalized, human-like AI responses.

## 🧩 System Architecture


1. **Frontend (Flask + HTML/CSS):** User interacts through a simple chat-style interface.  
2. **Emotion Detection Module:** Processes user text using NLP (keyword or ML-based).  
3. **Response Generator:** Produces dynamic, empathetic replies based on the detected emotion.  
4. **Output:** Displays detected emotion and response on the web page.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate a **Transformer-based NLP model** (like BERT or DistilBERT) for more accurate, context-aware emotion classification.  
- Add **Voice Emotion Detection** using audio feature extraction (`librosa`) and CNN models.  
- Implement **Facial Emotion Recognition** with `OpenCV` and deep learning.  
- Build a **Mood Tracking Dashboard** to visualize emotion patterns over time.  
- Introduce a **Memory/Personalization system** — the AI learns the user’s mood trends.  
- Integrate **Generative AI (LLM)** for dynamic, empathetic, and conversational responses.  
- Add **Multi-language support** to detect emotions in multiple regional languages.  
- Deploy MoodMate as a **mobile or web app** for public use.  
- Incorporate **privacy & ethical safeguards** for user data protection.  
- Enable **API endpoints** for external integration (chatbots, HR tools, wellness apps).
